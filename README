Perl6 LWP::Simple
=================

http://github.com/cosimo/perl6-lwp-simple/

This is a quick & dirty  implementation
of a LWP::Simple clone for Rakudo Perl 6

Dependencies
============

LWP::Simple depends on MIME::Base64, which
you can find at http://modules.perl6.org/


Current status
==============

As of 2010-07-11, runs with all recent rakudo builds.
It correctly follows redirects, but no infinite redirects
detection yet.

A known problem is that it corrupts binary files downloads.
